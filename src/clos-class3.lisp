;; CLtL2 28.1.5., ANSI CL 4.3.5. Determining the Class Precedence List

;; The set of all classes forms a directed graph: Class C is located
;; below the direct superclasses of C. This graph is acyclic, because
;; at the moment of definition of the class C all direct superclasses must
;; already be present.

;; Hence, one can use Noether Induction (Induction from above to below in
;; the class graph) .

;; For a class C let DS(n) be the list of all direct superclasses of C.
;; The set of all superclasses (incl. C itself) is inductively defined as
;; S(C) := {C} union union_{D in DS(C)} S(D).

;; In other words:
;; S(C) = { C_n : C_n in DS(C_{n-1}), ..., C_1 in DS(C_0), C_0 = C }

;; Lemma 1: (a) C in S(C).
;;          (b) DS(C) subset S(C).
;;          (c) D in DS(C) ==> S(D) subset S(C).
;;          (d) D in S(C) ==> S(D) subset S(C).
;; proof:  (a) follows from the definition.
;;         (b) from (a) and from the definition.
;;         (c) from the definition.
;;         (d) from (c) with fixed D via induction over C.

;; The CPL of a class C is one order of set S(C).
;; If CPL(C) = (... D1 ... D2 ...), one writes D1 < D2.
;; The relation introduced by this is a total order upon S(C).
;; The following set of restrictions has to be taken into account:
;; R(C) := union_{D in S(C)} DR(D)  with
;; DR(C) := { C < C1, C1 < C2, ..., C{n-1} < C_n } if DS(C) = (C1, ..., Cn).
;; If R(C) contains a cycle, R(C) cannot be completed into a total order,
;; of course. Then, R(C) is called inconsistent.
;; CPL(C) is constructed as follows:
;;   L := (), R := R(C).
;;   L := (L | C), remove all (C < ..) from R.
;;   while R /= {}, deal with the set M of all minimal elements of R
;;     (those classes, that can be added to L without violating R(C) ).
;;     If M is empty, then there is a cycle in R(C) and
;;     the algorithm is finished. Else, choose that element among the
;;     elements E of M, which has a D being rightmost in L with
;;     E in DS(D) .
;;     L := (L | E), remove all (E < ..) from R.
;;   CPL(C) := L.
;; L is lengthened stepwise by one element, R is shortened stepwise,
;; and R always consists solely of relations between elements
;; of S(C)\L.

;; Lemma 2: (a) CPL(C) = (C ...).
;;          (b) If DS(C) = (C1, ..., Cn), then
;;              CPL(C) = (C ... C1 ... C2 ... ... Cn ...).
;; proof:  (a) obvious by construction.
;;         (b) If Ci is added to the CPL, then the restriction
;;             C{i-1} < Ci can no longer be in R, so C{i-1} must already be
;;             in the CPL.

;; The following statement is wrong:
;; (*) If D is in DS(C) and CPL(D) = (D1, ..., Dn), then
;;     CPL(C) = (C ... D1 ... D2 ... ... Dn ...).
;; Example:
;;     z
;;    /|\             CPL(z) = (z)
;;   / | \            CPL(x) = (x z)
;;  x  |  x           CPL(y) = (y z)
;;  |  |  |           CPL(d) = (d x z)
;;  d  y  e           CPL(e) = (e x z)
;;   \/ \/            CPL(b) = (b d x y z)
;;   b   c            CPL(c) = (c y e x z)
;;    \ /             CPL(a) = (a b d c y e x z)

  ;; Class definitions change the type hierarchy, therefore the discriminating

  ;; The effective method cache does not need to be invalidated, since it takes
  ;; a sorted method list as input and compute-effective-method-as-function
  ;; doesn't do computations in the type hierarchy.
  ;;
  ;; Now, which generic functions are affected? The discriminating function of
  ;; a generic depends on the following. (x denotes an object occurring as
  ;; argument, and x-class means (class-of x).)
  ;; 1. The computation of the applicable method list for given arguments x
  ;;    depends on
  ;;      (subclassp x-class specializer)
  ;;    for all specializers occurring in methods of the GF.
  ;; 2. The discriminating function is also free to exploit the result of
  ;;      (subclassp specializer1 specializer2)
  ;;    for any two specializer1, specializer2 occurring in methods of the GF.
  ;; 3. The sorting of the applicable method list for given arguments x
  ;;    depends on the relative order of specializer1 and specializer2 in
  ;;    (cpl x-class), for any two specializer1, specializer2 occurring in
  ;;    methods of the GF.
  ;;
  ;; What effects can a change of (cpl class) = old-cpl -> new-cpl have?
  ;; Assume that some classes S+ are added, some classes S- are removed from
  ;; the CPL, and some classes S* are reordered in the CPL. What effects does
  ;; this have on (cpl o-class), where o-class is any other class?
  ;; - If o-class is not a subclass of class, (cpl o-class) doesn't change.
  ;; - If o-class if subclass of class,
  ;;     the elements of S+ are added or, if already present, possibly
  ;;     reordered,
  ;;     the elements of S- are possibly removed or reordered,
  ;;     the elements of S* are possibly reordered.
  ;;   ("Possibly" because o-class can also inherit from other classes that
  ;;   are not under the given class but under elements of S+, S-, S*.)
  ;;
  ;; Now back to the problem of finding the affected generic functions.
  ;; 1. (subclassp x-class specializer) == (member specializer (cpl x-class))
  ;;    - doesn't change if x-class is not a subclass of class,
  ;;    - doesn't change if specializer is not an element of S+ or S-.
  ;;    Because of the implicit "for all x", we cannot exploit the first
  ;;    statement. But the second statement tells us that we have to go
  ;;    from the elements of S+ and S- to the methods and generic functions
  ;;    using these classes as specializers.
  ;; 2. (subclassp specializer1 specializer2)
  ;;    == (member specializer2 (cpl specializer1))
  ;;    - doesn't change if specializer1 is not a subclass of class,
  ;;    - doesn't change if specializer2 is not an element of S+ or S-.
  ;;    So we have to intersect
  ;;    - the set of GFs using a subclass of class as specializer,
  ;;    - the set of GFs using an element of S+ or S- as specializer.
  ;;    This is a subset of the one we got in point 1. It is redundant.
  ;; 3. We know that if
  ;;          old (cpl x-class) = (... specializer1 ... specializer2 ...)
  ;;    and   new (cpl x-class) = (... specializer2 ... specializer1 ...)
  ;;    then x-class is a subclass of the given class, and one of
  ;;    specializer1, specializer2 (at least) is a member of S+, S- or S*.
  ;;    Because of the implicit "for all x", the first condition is hard to
  ;;    exploit: we need to recurse through all x-class that are subclasses
  ;;    the given class. It is easier to exploit the second condition:
  ;;    Go from the elements of S+, S-, S* to the methods and generic functions
  ;;    using these classes as specializers.
  ;;
  ;; Cf. MOP p. 41 compute-discriminating-function item (iv). This says that
  ;; all generic functions which use a specializer whose class precedence list
  ;; has changed (i.e. essentially a specializer which is a subclass of the
  ;; given class) should invalidate their discriminating function. This is not
  ;; needed!
