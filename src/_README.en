This is GNU CLISP, an ANSI Common Lisp implementation.


What is LISP?
-------------

LISP is a general purpose programming language.
It was invented by J. McCarthy in 1959.
There have been many dialects of it, but nowadays LISP has been standardized
and wide-spread due to the industrial standard ANSI COMMON LISP. There are
applications in the domains of symbolic knowledge processing (AI), numerical
mathematics (MACLISP yielded numerical code as good as FORTRAN), and
widely used programs like editors (EMACS) and CAD (AUTOCAD).
There are introductions to the language:

  Sheila Hughes: Lisp. Pitman Publishing Limited, London 1986.
  Paul Graham: "ANSI Common Lisp", Prentice Hall, 1995, ISBN 0133708756.
  <http://paulgraham.com/acl.html>
  and "On Lisp", Prentice Hall, 1993. ISBN 0130305529.
  <http://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html>

After a while wou will need the standard text containing the language
definition:

  Guy L. Steele Jr.: Common Lisp - The Language. Digital Press.
  1st edition, 1984, 465 pages.
  2nd edition, 1990, 1032 pages.

This book is available in HTML form via FTP from
  ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/lang/lisp/doc/cltl/cltl_ht.tgz
and can be viewed through WWW under
  http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html or

For experts: This standard text has emerged into an ANSI standard, which
you can get free of charge from

  http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/FrontMatter/

LISP is run in an interactive environment. You input forms, and they will be
evaluated at once. Thus you can inspect variables, call functions with given
arguments or define your own functions.

#ifndef UNIX_BINARY_DISTRIB
   src/clisp.c            source of the driver program
#endif
   src/config.lisp        site-dependent configuration
#ifdef WIN32_NATIVE
   clisp.exe              the driver which starts runtime and memory image
   install.bat,
   src/install.lisp       user-friendly installer
#endif


and - for your convenience, if you like reading sources -

   src/*.lisp             the source of lispinit.mem
   src/*.fas              the same files, already compiled


Installation:
-------------

#if defined(UNIX) || defined(WIN32)
#if defined(UNIX) && !defined(UNIX_BINARY_DISTRIB)
Type

         make

#endif
Optionally, change the strings in src/config.lisp, using a text editor.
#else
Optionally, edit the contents of config.lisp appropriately for your site,
especially the definitions of short-site-name and long-site-name.
You may also want to edit the time zone definition at the end of
timezone.lisp.
#endif
If you did, you need to save these changes in the memory image: start

#ifdef WIN32_NATIVE
         clisp.exe
#endif
#ifdef UNIX
         base/lisp.run -M base/lispinit.mem
#endif

When the LISP prompt

      [1]> _

appears, type

#if defined(UNIX) || defined(WIN32)
      (without-package-lock ()
        (load (compile-file "src/config.lisp")))
#else
      (without-package-lock ()
        (load (compile-file "config.lisp")))

and - in case you modified timezone.lisp -

      (without-package-lock ()
        (load (compile-file "timezone.lisp")))
#endif

and then

#ifdef UNIX
        (cd "base/")
#endif
        (saveinitmem)

to overwrite the file lispinit.mem with your configuration. Then

        (exit)

The rest is done by

#ifdef UNIX
        make install
#endif
#ifdef WIN32_NATIVE
        install.bat
#endif


When you encounter problems:
----------------------------

After errors, you are in the debugger:

     Break 1 [2]> _

You can evaluate forms, as usual. Furthermore:

     Help
               prints context-sensitive help
     Abort     or
     Unwind
               climbs up to the next higher input loop
     Backtrace
               shows the contents of the stack, helpful for debugging

And you can look at the values of the variables of the functions where the
error occurred.
See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/debugger.html> for more information.
