;; work around a possible bug in ln(1) on symbolic links:
;; according to the Linux ln(1):
;;    "making a hard link to a symbolic link is not portable":
;; SVR4 (Solaris, Linux) create symbolic links
;;    (breaks when the target is relative)
;; Cygwin (1.3.12) is even worse: it makes hard links to the symbolic link,
;;    instead of resolving the symbolic link.
;; Good behavior means creating a hard link to the symbolic link's target.
;; this bug is detected by CL_PROG_HLN in src/m4/ln.m4
;; cf gl_AC_FUNC_LINK_FOLLOWS_SYMLINK in gnulib/m4/link-follow.m4
;;
;; To avoid this, use this lisp program: the syscalls module works
;; around the above difficulty
